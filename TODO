- add data descriptors like "const" (in progress)
- cache coherence and false sharing tests (development)
- implementation of fourier slice theorem to generate images or reconstruct 
  from images
- cryo-EM based structure factor correction 
- beadmodel generation from density maps
- parallel rendering pipeline
- optional trajectoty support 
- XPLOR output 
- enable CCP4 IO using MRC
- more fourier space methods to reduce needed fourier transforms 
- write a real documentation
